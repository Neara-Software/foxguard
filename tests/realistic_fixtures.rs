// Integration test for the realistic test corpus (issue #35).
//
// Each fixture under `tests/fixtures/realistic/` is a small-but-complete
// vulnerable application for one supported framework. We pin the exact
// total finding count and the exact count per taint rule. Any rule
// addition or engine change will break these counts, which is the whole
// point: it forces explicit acknowledgment of precision shifts.
//
// The fixtures also contain NEAR-MISS functions whose line ranges must
// not contain any `*/taint-*` findings. We check that indirectly by
// pinning the total taint-finding count per file — if a NEAR-MISS
// function started firing, the total would change.

/// composition is taint-flow-sensitive, so the chain BREAKS: no taint finding on
/// a directory scan (only the sink file's regex hit remains).
