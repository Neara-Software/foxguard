# foxguard GitHub App

Tracking issue: [0sec-labs/foxguard#246](https://github.com/0sec-labs/foxguard/issues/246).

**Status: live in production.** The App is registered under `0sec-labs`, receives webhooks at `https://foxguard.0sec.ai`, and runs as a container on the 0cloud k3s cluster, scanning pull requests across its installations.

This directory hosts the in-tree pieces of the GitHub App webhook receiver. The receiver is built behind the `github-app` feature flag so the core scanner build stays lean for users who only want the CLI:

```sh
# Build the App receiver binary
cargo build --release --features github-app --bin foxguard-github-app
```

## What's here today (Phase 1)

- `webhook.rs` — HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`verify_signature`) and the `EventKind` router enum. 10 unit tests pin the verification contract: known-good vector, modified body, wrong secret, missing/empty/non-hex/short-length digest, trailing-whitespace tolerance, and the kind-routing map.
- `auth.rs` — GitHub App JWT generation, installation-token exchange, and conservative in-memory token caching. It reads app credentials from `FOXGUARD_GITHUB_APP_ID` and either `FOXGUARD_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` or an absolute `FOXGUARD_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, and keeps the outbound GitHub API base URL configurable for tests and allowlisted GitHub Enterprise hosts.
- `installation_store.rs` — small JSON-backed installation registry. It records account metadata and selected repositories from `installation` / `installation_repositories` webhooks so self-hosted operators can recover install state across restarts without a database dependency.
- `src/bin/foxguard_github_app.rs` — axum-based HTTP server with `/healthz` and `/webhook` endpoints. Verifies the signature, routes by `X-GitHub-Event`, extracts installation IDs from JSON payloads, persists installation metadata, and admits pull-request work to a bounded queue (128 pending jobs and 4 workers by default). Replayed GitHub delivery IDs are deduplicated; concurrent updates for the same repository/PR coalesce so the newest head gets one follow-up scan instead of racing or being lost. Overload is acknowledged with `202 Accepted` and logged. Workers prepare installation auth, clone and scan pull-request heads in a bounded temp workspace, post foxguard PR review comments and a check run, and clear cached tokens when installations are deleted. The PR scan runs the full tree first (whole-repo cross-file taint context) and, only if it exceeds `FOXGUARD_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 60), falls back to a diff-scoped scan of just the PR's changed files (`--changed-files-from`), with non-code paths (`tests/fixtures`, `vendor`, `node_modules`, minified/`dist`/`build`) excluded on both paths.
- `review.rs` — installation-token GitHub REST client for PR review comments and check runs. It deletes prior foxguard review comments, lists changed PR files, filters findings to commentable diff lines, posts inline comments using the shared CLI comment formatter, and creates a `foxguard` check run with up to 50 annotations.

## App configuration (registered & live)

The production App is registered under `0sec-labs` and installed at `https://foxguard.0sec.ai`. It requests **exactly** the permissions and webhook events the receiver consumes — anything less fails at runtime, anything more is over-scoped:

  **Repository permissions**
  - `contents: read` — used by `git clone --filter=blob:none` of the PR head (`src/bin/foxguard_github_app.rs`).
  - `pull_requests: read` — used to list PR files and existing comments (`src/github_app/review.rs`, `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/files`, `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments`).
  - `pull_requests: write` — used to post and delete foxguard review comments (`POST` / `DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{id}`).
  - `checks: write` — used to create the `foxguard` check run with annotations (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs`).

  **Subscribed events**
  - `pull_request` — triggers the clone + scan + comment + check-run loop.
  - `installation` — keeps `installation_store.rs` in sync when the App is installed, suspended, or uninstalled (also clears the cached installation token on deletion).
  - `installation_repositories` — keeps the registry in sync when a user adds or removes repos from an existing installation.

  `ping` is delivered automatically by GitHub at webhook setup; the receiver handles it but it is not a subscribable event.

## Running locally

```sh
export FOXGUARD_WEBHOOK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export FOXGUARD_GITHUB_APP_ID=12345
export FOXGUARD_GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private-key.pem
# Optional for GitHub Enterprise:
# export FOXGUARD_GITHUB_API_BASE_URL=https://github.example.com/api/v3
# export FOXGUARD_GITHUB_ALLOWED_API_HOSTS=github.example.com
# Optional install metadata location (defaults to ./.foxguard-github-app/installations.json):
# export FOXGUARD_INSTALLATIONS_PATH=/var/lib/foxguard-github-app/installations.json
export FOXGUARD_BIND=127.0.0.1:8080
# Optional admission controls (positive integers):
# export FOXGUARD_PR_QUEUE_CAPACITY=128
# export FOXGUARD_PR_WORKERS=4
foxguard-github-app
```

For testing without GitHub:

```sh
BODY='{"zen":"hello"}'
SECRET="$FOXGUARD_WEBHOOK_SECRET"
SIG="sha256=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$SECRET" | cut -d' ' -f2)"
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: ping" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Delivery: test-1" \
  -H "X-Hub-Signature-256: $SIG" \
  --data "$BODY"
# → 202
```

## Self-hosting

A reference Dockerfile lives at the repo root: [`Dockerfile.github-app`](../../Dockerfile.github-app). It builds the binary with the `github-app` feature, drops to a non-root user, and exposes `:8080`. Operators can deploy it to anything that runs containers (Fly.io, Railway, ECS, a tiny VM); the only persistent state is the install metadata JSON file, which is fine on a single small mounted volume.

## Status

Live in production. The receiver covers the full App loop: verified webhook intake, installation metadata persistence (durable via a mounted volume), installation-token auth, bounded PR checkout + scan (full-tree with diff-scoped fallback on timeout, configurable via `FOXGUARD_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SECS`, noise-path exclusions), PR review comment posting filtered to changed lines, and check-run annotations.
