//! Semgrep-compatible YAML bridge for `mode: taint` rules.
//!
//! This module parses a *narrow* subset of Semgrep's taint-mode schema into
//! foxguard's [`TaintSpec`] so that users can load existing Semgrep taint
//! rules via `--rules` without rewriting them.
//!
//! # Supported today
//!
//! - `mode: taint` with `languages: [python]`, `languages: [javascript]` /
//!   `[typescript]` / `[js]` / `[ts]`, `languages: [go]` / `[golang]`,
//!   `languages: [java]`, `languages: [c]`, `languages: [kotlin]` /
//!   `[kt]`, `languages: [ruby]` / `[rb]`, or `languages: [php]`.
//!   Other languages are rejected with a warning and the rule is skipped;
//!   non-taint rules fall through to the regular Semgrep bridge.
//! - `pattern-sources`, `pattern-sinks`, `pattern-sanitizers` as lists of
//!   single-`pattern:` entries, `pattern-either:` lists (which may nest
//!   recursively and flatten into multiple matchers for the same role), **or**
//!   `patterns:` AND-blocks (see below).
//! - `patterns:` AND-blocks inside source/sink/sanitizer entries: the bridge
//!   extracts all `pattern:` and `pattern-either:` sub-items as expressible
//!   matchers. Constraint-only sub-items (`pattern-inside:`, `pattern-not:`,
//!   `focus-metavariable:`, `metavariable-*:`) are dropped with a per-key
//!   warning (documented broadening — see COMPATIBILITY.md). If the block
//!   produces at least one expressible matcher, the entry is loaded; otherwise
//!   the entry is warn-skipped without aborting the whole rule.
//! - Severity mapping via the same `map_severity` used by the pattern-rule
//!   bridge (`ERROR` → Critical, `WARNING` → High, `INFO` → Medium).
//! - `metadata.cwe` propagated to findings.
//!
//! # Unsupported (rule is skipped with a warning)
//!
//! - Any `mode: taint` rule that does not target Python, JavaScript/TypeScript,
//!   Go, Java, C, or Kotlin.
//! - Any `pattern:` string whose shape is not one of:
//!   - bare identifier (`request`) — compiled to `ParamName`
//!   - dotted attribute chain (`request.data`, `request.json`) — compiled
//!     to `Attribute { root, field }` using the *leftmost* identifier and
//!     the *outermost* attribute (nested chains like `request.session.id`
//!     are flattened to `root="request", field="id"`; documented as a known
//!     gap that matches the engine's own one-level attribute propagation).
//!   - call form (`pickle.loads($X)`, `pickle.loads(...)`, `func($X)`,
//!     `func()`) — compiled to `Call { canonical }`, stripping arguments.
//!   - metavariable-receiver call (`$CONN.executeQuery($X)`,
//!     `$OBJ.innerHTML($X)`) — compiled to `MethodName { method }`, which
//!     matches any invocation of that method name regardless of receiver.
//!     Only valid as a sink or sanitizer shape; rejected as a source.
//!   - metavariable-receiver assignment (`$EL.innerHTML = $X`,
//!     `$EL.outerHTML = $X`) — compiled to `MemberAssign { field }`, which
//!     matches any property-assignment sink whose property name equals
//!     `field`. Only meaningful for JavaScript/TypeScript rules (the JS
//!     engine recognises this as a DOM-XSS sink pattern); other language
//!     engines include the matcher in the compiled spec but silently ignore
//!     it. Only valid as a sink or sanitizer shape; rejected as a source.
//!
//! A `patterns:` entry with NO expressible matchers (only constraint-only
//! sub-items) is warn-skipped. If all source or sink entries are warn-skipped
//! and none survive, the whole rule is skipped.
