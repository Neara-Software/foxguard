Today we are shipping a big workflow upgrade in **foxguard v0.7.0**:

`foxguard tui`

The goal is simple: keep the speed of local scanning, but make triage feel like a product instead of raw terminal output.

## Why we built this

Local security only works when developers can move from:

- finding appears
- risk is understandable
- fix path is obvious
- decision is quick

Fast scans get you the first step.

A good triage UX gets you the rest.

## What is new in v0.7.0

### New interactive command

The interactive mode is now first-class:

```bash
npx foxguard tui .
```

And supports focused modes too:

```bash
npx foxguard tui --diff main .
npx foxguard tui --secrets .
```

We renamed the public command surface from `ui` to `tui` to keep `ui` available for future web experiences.

### Launch screen and loading transitions

The TUI now opens into a dedicated launch picker with three modes:

- Scan
- Diff
- Secrets

Scans do not start automatically. You choose mode first, then launch.

We also added a shared loading transition with shimmer placeholders, so initial run and rescan flow feel consistent.

### Better detail view and open-target workflow

Inside findings, the detail pane now shows:

- richer source context
- clearer snippet section
- explicit `Open` target controls (`finding` / `source` / `sink`)
- dataflow path rendering when trace data exists

`Tab` cycles open targets, and `Enter` opens the currently selected target in your editor.

Even when no source/sink trace exists, the open target remains visible so the `Enter` behavior is clear.

### Triage actions directly in the TUI

Press `i` on a finding to open triage actions.

Actions include:

- mark reviewed / todo / ignore candidate
- clear review state
- add to baseline
- ignore rules in config (scan and secrets flows)

The action menu includes a preview of what will be written before you apply it.

### Diff and secrets workflows feel native

Diff mode and secrets mode now share the same UX language as scan mode:

- same launch flow
- same loading states
- same footer and key-hint system
- same in-app triage patterns

## UX improvements that shipped along the way

We made a long series of improvements while building this release:

- findings list readability improvements
- cleaner detail panel hierarchy
- better severity and review state badges
- removal of redundant dataflow toggles
- shared status/footer components across screens
- more deliberate color and spacing for selected states

The result is less "terminal clutter" and a tighter triage loop.

## Screenshot / demo placeholders

Add your screenshots in this section before publishing:

1. Launch screen mode picker
2. Loading shimmer transition
3. Findings + detail split view
4. Triage action menu
5. Dataflow with source/sink open targets

## Upgrade notes

- interactive command: use `tui`
- old `ui` naming is no longer the primary surface
- existing non-interactive scan commands are unchanged

## Try it

```bash
npx foxguard@latest tui .
```

If you already use local scans in CI hooks/editor tasks, this release is meant to make the "what now?" step dramatically faster.
